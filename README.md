# Hello! I'm Federico Benelli

I'm a Chemical Engineer now doing my PhD in thermodynamics, specifically
in designing computational algorithms for PVT simulation of reservoir fluids.

I mostly program in _Python_ and _Fortran_, nowadays I'm really digging into
bridging between the two with _f2py_, mostly to take old code into nice modern
interfaces or to make new and high performant code with ease of use.

## Hobbies

Besides my work, I'm also a Linux enthusiast, right now I'm rocking Arch Linux
in my main desktop and Artix on my Laptop. I keep in sync most of the files 
between both computers with `rsync` and my dotfiles are in their own repo 
![dotfiles](www.github.com/fedebenelli/dotfiles), each computer has it's own
branch.

## Some stats, not that they mean much imo
