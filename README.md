# Hello! I'm Federico Benelli
I'm a Chemical Engineer now doing my PhD in thermodynamics, specifically
in designing computational algorithms for PVT simulation of reservoir fluids.

I mostly program in _Python_ and _Fortran_, nowadays I'm really digging into
bridging between the two with _f2py_, mostly to take old code into nice modern
interfaces or to make new and high-performant code with ease of use.

My principal projects are:

- [yaeos](https://www.github.com/fedebenelli/yaeos), a Fortran library for
  equations of state related calculations, with a heavy emphasis in
  ease of extensibility and usage. Using both automatic differentiation
  and analytical derivatives approaches to exploit the best of both worlds.

- [PyForFluids](https://www.github.com/fedebenelli/pyforfluids), a Python
  module that estimates thermodynamic properties of fluids based on Equations
  of State. It uses Fortran code in the background to assure high performance
  in the calculations.

## Hobbies
Besides my work, I'm also a Linux enthusiast, right now I'm rocking Arch Linux
in both my main desktop and my Laptop. I keep in sync most of the files 
between both computers with `SyncThing`, my dotfiles are in their own repo
[dotfiles](https://www.github.com/fedebenelli/dotfiles), each computer has it's
own branch.
