# Hello! I'm Federico Benelli
I'm a Chemical Engineer now doing my PhD in thermodynamics, specifically
in designing computational algorithms for PVT simulation of reservoir fluids.

I mostly program in _Python_ and _Fortran_, nowadays I'm really digging into
bridging between the two with _f2py_, mostly to take old code into nice modern
interfaces or to make new and high performant code with ease of use.

My principal projects are:

- [feos](https://www.github.com/fedebenelli/feos), a Fortran library for
  equations of state related calculations, with a heavy emphasis in
  ease of extensibility and usage.

- [PyForFluids](https://www.github.com/fedebenelli/pyforfluids), a Python
  module that estimates thermodynamic properties of fluids based on Ecuations
  of State. It uses Fortran code in the background to assure high performance
  in the calculations. For some of the calculations it uses `feos` in the
  background.


## Hobbies
Besides my work, I'm also a Linux enthusiast, right now I'm rocking Arch Linux
in both my main desktop and my Laptop. I keep in sync most of the files 
between both computers with `SyncThing`, my dotfiles are in their own repo
[dotfiles](https://www.github.com/fedebenelli/dotfiles), each computer has it's
own branch.
