# Hello! I'm Federico Benelli
I'm a Chemical Engineer now doing my PhD in thermodynamics, specifically
in designing computational algorithms for PVT simulation of reservoir fluids.
My focus is mainly on phase diagrams tracing (isoplets, isotherms) of multicomponent
mixtures using Equations of State.

My principal projects are:

- [fenvelopes](https://www.github.com/fedebenelli/fenvelopes) Fortran software
  for multicomponent systems phase diagrams tracing with Equations of State.
  Right not it provides the possibility of calculation of PT (isoplets) and
  Px (isotherms) using Cubic Equations of State.

- [yaeos](https://www.github.com/fedebenelli/yaeos), a Fortran library for
  equations of state related calculations, with a heavy emphasis in
  ease of extensibility and usage. Using both automatic differentiation
  and analytical derivatives approaches to exploit the best of both worlds.
  of State. It uses Fortran code in the background to assure high performance
  in the calculations.
